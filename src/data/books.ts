        "But I have promises to keep
        And miles to go before I sleep.”
        A chilling voice echoes from the shadows — too calm, too rehearsed. Too calm.
      The sound of an iron rod being dragged up a stairwell slices through the silence like a scream with its throat cut. In the corner of a pitch-dark room, a child whimpers. The air feels tight, humid — as though the building itself is holding its breath.

But no visual is perfect. Everything flickers.

The footsteps get closer. The voice gets clearer.

“Aaaand mmmiiillleessss toooo ggoooo befffooorreee YOOOUUU sslllllleeeeep…”

WHAM.

The iron rod crashes down.

Darkness swallows the scene.

From within it, Nanda stirs — breath ragged, chest heaving. A faint tremble courses through his limbs. Sweat pools on his brow, soaking into the pillow. His eyelids flutter violently, eyes darting beneath closed lids as though desperately searching for a way out.

Inside the dream — no, the nightmare — voices clash. Now he’s ported somewhere else, yet it feels eerily similar. Dark. Flickering lights. But the visuals are clearer than before. Someone is crying, pleading, screaming to be sent away. To go home. The desperation is primal, childlike, maddening.

And his body — broken. Bruises darken his skin, a deep gash slashes across his left shoulder, blood snakes down from the back of his skull. A rusty piece of metal tears through his right calf. His hands are soaked in red. Yet he moves forward, limping, trembling, refusing to fall.

Voices screech and whisper from all directions, wrapping around him like a storm.

A towering clock looms in the center of the chaos.

Its hands spin faster and faster — time unraveling.

Then comes the alarm.

Deafening. Violent.

BANG!

A brutal strike. The world collapses.

Nanda shoots up in bed, gasping for breath. The silence is sharp — unnaturally still, like the room itself has been holding its breath with him.

He clutches his chest, drenched in sweat. His legs tremble beneath the blanket, quivering like they’ve lived the nightmare in flesh and bone.

The digital clock glares: 4:30 AM.

Its red glow pulses in the dark — cold, watchful, accusing.

He rubs his eyes — vision blurred from too little sleep. Maybe an hour and a half. Maybe less.

He wipes the sweat from his brow, then his neck, then the back of his ears — where it feels like the dream-blood still clings. His skin crawls. His heart thuds in his throat.

Was it just a dream?

His hands, pale in the dim light, don’t feel like his own.

He scans the room, trying to anchor himself. Wardrobe. Window. Desk. The peeling poster of one of his paintings. The hum of the ceiling fan. Normal. Familiar. But something’s off.

And then — the deeper discomfort:

He can’t remember last night.

Not dinner. Not going to bed. Not a single detail.

Only the dream remains.

Raw. Vivid. Real.

He staggers out of bed, muscles aching, and splashes cold water on his face. The radio flickers to life. Chaganti Koteswara Rao garu’s voice fills the silence:

“…thellavarujhamuna nalugu gantalaki levaalani alarm pettukuni, moodu gantalu chaduvudaam anukuntadu…”

The voice fades.

Nanda stares at himself in the mirror. His reflection doesn’t feel like him. Those eyes — empty, rimmed with fatigue — hold no spark. He looks like someone barely surviving.

He peels a banana from the table, dips a spoon in honey, and consumes them mechanically. An old Telugu song hums softly from a worn-out speaker.

He changes into gym clothes, packs his shoes and protein shake, and steps into the grey morning. The city hasn’t woken up yet. A light drizzle begins to fall. Summer has no hold over the sky.

As he jogs, the dream clings to him like wet clothes. Each image replays — those screams, the clocktower, the blood. His breath grows heavier.

Then—

WHAM!

A sudden blow to the back. Sharp. Disorienting.

He stumbles forward. The world spins. In the blur, he sees someone. No scarf. No mask. Just a shaved head — roughly grown back, patchy. The rest of the figure is shadowed, ungraspable. Standing above him — on a jeep, maybe, or a ledge — watching.

Nanda’s body gives in.

Tires screech. Voices echo — elderly, panicked. A group of old men rush toward him, shouting, lifting his broken body.

Darkness again.

He opens his eyes. Everything is faded and too bright. A ceiling fan spins above. He turns to see his friend Panda asleep in a plastic chair, chin to chest. Two older people murmur near the door, casting glances at him.

Pain pulses behind his eyes. He winces and shifts.

One of the elders calls out, and Panda wakes with a start.

“Ra, you’re awake! Don’t worry… just relax,” Panda says, walking over. “You’re safe now.

Nanda tries to speak but a lump catches in his throat. No words come.

“Chill bro,” Panda says with a weak smile. “Sleep did good to you. Everything’s okay.”

But everything isn’t okay. Nanda knows it.

He leans back. Music — slow, emotional — fades in.

His memories return in waves. The blow. The fall. His shoulder scraping against a rusted electric pole. The sting as a crushed cool drink can slices his calf. His fingers sliding across the blood pooling at the back of his neck — red-stained hands just like in the dream.

His breath catches.

He awakes again. Not with panic, but with dread.

He’s not in his room. No alarm clock. No familiar walls. Just a hospital monitor and a saline drip.

His body feels drained, like something vital has been taken.

Panda leans over him, cheerful as always, masking concern.

Nanda’s voice is hoarse. “Panda… the dream I had… it was the same. Everything that happened… I saw it before.”

Panda raises an eyebrow and waves a hand dismissively. “You’re just shaken up. Must be your brain playing back stuff. Rest first. We’ll talk.”

“No… I’m telling you. The bruises, the fall, the man I saw. It was all in my dream… before it happened.”

“Maybe it’s all coincidence,” he says casually. “Dreams are weird like that. You’ll laugh about this in a week.”

Nanda doesn’t respond.

His eyes fix on nothing.

He can’t decide which is worse — the dream, or the fact that it’s starting to come true.

When Panda steps out to speak with the doctor, Nanda stares at the ceiling fan, trying to hold on to the fragments slipping away. His mind feels fractured — like someone has taken scissors to his thoughts and stitched them back unevenly.

There’s something else. Something about the man who hit him.

He shuts his eyes, forcing the memory to rewind. The blur. The swing. The fall. The face — no, not a face — the scalp. A recently shaved head. And for a fleeting moment, he remembers… a scar. A faint, curved scar along the temple. Familiar.

His heart skips.

“I’ve seen that before,” he whispers. “Where?”

A knock at the door interrupts his thoughts. One of the elderly men peeks in and smiles gently. “You’re lucky, son. That hit — could’ve been worse.”

Nanda gives a weak nod. “Did anyone… see the attacker?”

The old man shakes his head. “Just a shadow. He vanished. Like a ghost.”

A chill prickles his skin.

When the room falls silent again, he turns slowly toward the glass window. His reflection stares back at him. Pale. Weary. Broken.

A shiver runs through him, subtle but sharp. He can’t explain it — not to Panda, not even to himself — but something in his gut tells him this isn’t over. That the dream… or whatever it is… has just begun writing itself into reality.

As the hospital hallway buzzes faintly outside, Nanda lies still — body broken, mind restless, and the unknown closing in like dusk.

He doesn’t feel safe.

He feels watched.

Colder.

Darker.

Gone in a blink.

Nanda shuts his eyes, panic curling in his chest.

Something is wrong.

Very wrong.

        title: 'The man outside',
        content: `The hospital room hummed with the quiet unease of early morning. Faint sunlight bled through the blinds, striping Nanda’s blanket in gold and shadow. The steady beeping of the monitor was the only rhythm in the silence.
Nanda stared at the ceiling, unmoving. Not asleep, not awake—caught in a strange in-between. Panda sat nearby, scrolling through his phone, occasionally glancing over like a man watching a fire that hasn’t gone out yet.
A nurse entered, her footsteps soft. She adjusted his drip, noted something on the chart, and left without a word. Nanda watched her go.
“How long was I out?” he asked finally, voice dry as bone.
Panda looked up. “Almost ten hours since they brought you in. They said you were conscious for a bit, then knocked out again. Mild concussion. Nothing fractured. You’re lucky.”
“Lucky…” Nanda repeated, almost to himself. He turned his head. “Did the police come?”
Panda hesitated. “Yeah. Briefly. They asked some questions. No witnesses. No cameras. They think it might’ve been a mugging… random hit-and-run kind of thing.”
“But they didn’t take anything.”
“I know.”
Nanda closed his eyes.
That man. That figure. That stare.
“Did you… see anyone, Panda? Around the hospital? Anyone strange?”
Panda shook his head. “No one except the oldies who helped you and me. What’s this about?”
Nanda didn’t answer. He was remembering something else now. Just before he blacked out—his own voice screaming in the dream: “I don’t want to be here. Let me go. Send me home.”
But the voice hadn’t sounded like him. Not quite.
“Do you think dreams can warn us?” he asked suddenly.
Panda raised an eyebrow. “You mean, like premonitions?”
“Or something worse,” Nanda murmured. “Like pieces of something we’ve forgotten.”
Panda looked at him carefully now. “Bro… you hit your head. Your body’s in shock. Don’t go full Netflix series on me.”
Nanda smirked faintly but didn’t reply.
Later, when Panda stepped out to get chai, Nanda slowly swung his legs over the bed. Every muscle screamed in protest. He caught his reflection in the steel panel of the monitor—unkempt, bloodshot, hollow. For a split second, he thought the reflection moved when he didn’t.
He jerked back.
The image settled.
The monitor beeped faster.
He looked down at his arm. Goosebumps.
There was something under his skin—a feeling, not physical, but pressing. Like something was waiting to rise. A memory. A name. A face.
But every time he tried to grasp it, it slipped.
He stood, wobbling, and moved toward the window. Outside, the hospital courtyard was empty except for a janitor sweeping dead leaves. Just as he turned away, he saw it:
A man across the street. Standing still. Shaved head. Watching.
Nanda froze.
The man didn’t move. Didn’t wave. Just stared.
A blink.
Gone.
The space where he’d stood was empty.
Nanda backed away from the glass.
But then—
The man outside began to appear closer. Not walking. Just… nearer.
Every blink, every breath—closer.
Nanda’s vision started to warp. Blurring. Jig-sagging. Like an old VHS tape struggling to play. His eyes twitched, fought to focus. He rubbed them furiously, once, twice—each time the man leapt nearer in distance.
He felt sweat bead down his temple. “No. No. What is this?”
He screamed.
“WHO ARE YOU?! WHO ARE YOUUUUU!”
Then—a grip on his shoulder. Firm. Real.
“NANDA!” a voice yelled behind him.
He spun.
Gone. The man outside vanished.
The room steadied.
The monitor beside him blared its warning tone. A nurse burst in, followed by the doctor.
“Nanda, what happened?” the doctor asked, gripping his wrist, checking vitals.
Nanda stammered. “He was there—outside—staring—he kept coming closer—I couldn’t breathe—he was just like—just like before—”
He started gasping. Chest heaving. Eyes darting like trapped animals.
Then—he crumpled. His legs gave out. The nurse caught him as he collapsed, unconscious.
Darkness swept in.
 “Later, as they settled him back into the bed, the doctor turned to Panda.
“We’ll have to observe him overnight. If it’s not neurological… it might be psychological.”
Panda nodded, but his face was unreadable.
He knew better.
As the hallway lights dimmed, Panda sat by Nanda’s side again. His voice was quiet.
“You didn’t imagine him, did you?”
Nanda, barely conscious, twitched at the sound.
Panda looked at the window, now empty.
He whispered, “I remember what happened before. It’s foolish to have her in your thoughts and spoil your health..Still holding on to her. Letting her haunt your mind like this. She’s gone. And you’re wrecking yourself because of memories.”
Suddenly, a knock at the door. A doctor entered, clipboard in hand. He offered a polite smile before glancing at the monitors.
“Vitals look good. You gave us a scare,” he said. “MRI, EEG, CT—everything’s clean. Physically, you’re fine.”
“Then why… why do I feel like this?” Nanda asked, eyes wide.
The doctor exhaled. “You’ve barely slept in months. Eight months, according to your records. That kind of deprivation… it can break your brain’s ability to separate dream from memory. Reality from hallucination.”
Nanda’s lips trembled. He looked at Panda for reassurance. But Panda… Panda wasn’t surprised.
The doctor gave a reassuring pat. “You need rest. Deep, consistent rest. And we’ll be monitoring you closely.”
He left as quietly as he came.
Panda stood in silence, then gave a half-smile.
“I know what you’re thinking,” Nanda said.
Panda didn’t reply. He just turned to the window.
As the light outside faded, the hallway grew quieter. The doctor stepped into the corridor with Panda, holding a folder of reports.
“All scans are clear,” the doctor said. “There’s no physical trauma to his brain. MRI, EEG, everything’s normal. But… it’s the sleep. Or the lack of it. Eight months of irregular, broken rest? The mind can start bending.”
Panda didn’t say anything. Just nodded.
Only he knew what Nanda had been through. What he had survived. What still lingered, unspoken, in the shadows of memory.
A strange expression crossed Panda’s face—half pain, half frustration, and something older. Older than even fear.
He gave a pained smile and turned to walk back into Nanda’s ward.
But when he opened the door—
The bed was empty.
Nanda was gone.`,

        number:3,
        content: `The air outside the hospital ward was thick with the smell of antiseptic and wilting bougainvillea from the garden. Somewhere nearby, a wheelchair creaked faintly. Nanda stood barefoot on the dew-touched lawn, shivering slightly under his hospital gown, eyes scanning the street beyond the fence.
The figure was gone. Again. Just like that.
He didn’t know why he was out there — only that he had to look. Had to make sure he wasn’t losing it.
Behind him, rushed footsteps.
“Nanda!” Panda’s voice sliced through the silence.
Nanda turned. Panda looked both relieved and furious.
“Are you insane?” he hissed, grabbing his arm. “You want to collapse again out here in the middle of the damn courtyard?”
“I saw him again,” Nanda said softly, eyes darting around. “He was there. I’m not lying, Panda. I’m not—”
“I know you’re not lying,” Panda interrupted, his grip softening. “But whatever this is… whatever you think you’re seeing… it’s eating you alive.”
He steadied Nanda and guided him back toward the ward.
By late afternoon, the discharge papers were signed. The doctor gave one last word of advice — rest, routine, therapy if needed. Nanda nodded at all the right moments but heard none of it. His mind was already elsewhere.
Panda helped him into the cab waiting outside.
The drive through the city felt surreal. People moved normally — shopping, chatting, hawking fruit by the road. As if nothing had happened.
The auto ride back to his building was silent. Panda kept stealing glances at Nanda, who stared blankly out the window, his reflection pale in the scratched glass.
But it was only when they turned into his lane that reality hit.
Neighbors had gathered in clusters — some watering plants, some pretending to be busy. But all eyes turned to the car.
When they reached his lane, a few neighbors peeked from their doors.
“There he is,” one of them muttered.
“That’s the boy who collapsed on the main road, na?” another whispered loudly enough to be heard.
“Back again,” said another. “God knows what he’s gotten himself into this time.”
“He screams at night. You’ve heard, no? Just last week, at 2 AM… like he was being hunted.”
“Yeah, yeah,” a voice added. “I saw him once walking shirtless on the road, middle of the night. Eyes wide, muttering to himself.”
“And you know what the saddest part is?” said a woman in a low voice. “This isn’t even new. Poor guy’s been like this for months now. Ever since that girl left him.”
“He should get help,” someone else muttered. “Before he hurts himself… or someone else.”
Nanda stepped out of the cab slowly. Every eye felt like a spotlight. Every whisper, a cut.
Panda stepped out behind him, carrying the hospital bag.
Nanda kept walking, head down. He could feel their eyes clinging to him like stains.
An old aunty from two doors down greeted him with cautious pity. “Are you okay now, beta? Don’t do such scary things again, okay?”
He gave her a half-smile and a nod, unable to meet her eyes.
Panda opened the lock to Nanda’s modest one-room flat. The air inside was stale. Dishes sat in the sink. The blanket on the mattress was still crumpled from the morning he’d left for his jog — the morning everything twisted.
“Rest,” Panda said, pulling a chair close to the bed. “You need to rest.”
Nanda sat down slowly. The familiar walls felt distant now, like the room belonged to someone else. Someone who hadn’t screamed in his sleep. Someone whose mind hadn’t betrayed him.
Panda stood at the doorway for a moment, hands in pockets. “I’ll get you some food.”
Before Nanda could reply, Panda was gone.
Alone now, Nanda stared at the ceiling. Same cracks. Same water stain shaped like a crooked bird.
But everything felt different.
Because the nightmares weren’t fading.
And neither was the feeling that something — or someone — was watching.
Nanda lay back slowly on the mattress, eyes locked on the crooked bird stain above. His body ached — not with pain, but with memory. Every square inch of the room held echoes: of panic, of loneliness, of nights when he’d screamed into his own pillow just to silence the noise in his head.
The murmurs outside the gate had faded, but they still rang in his ears.
“Ever since that girl left him…”
“Roaming shirtless, muttering to himself…”
He closed his eyes, but the silence was heavy. Pressing down on him like an invisible hand. Then—
Thud.
His eyes snapped open.
A faint sound. From the kitchen.
He hadn’t touched anything since returning.
Nanda sat up, heart beginning to pound. He listened again. Nothing. But the stale air suddenly felt colder. Tighter.
He stood and walked softly toward the kitchen corner — just a small counter, a sink full of unwashed plates, and a dusty water filter.
Nothing was there.
He turned to go back — and then froze.
The photo frame on the wall above his desk. Crooked. Tilted to the side.
He hadn’t touched it in days. He would’ve remembered.
Slowly, almost reluctantly, he walked toward it.
It was a picture from a year ago — taken during a team trip. His arm around her shoulder. Her head tilted toward him, eyes closed, smiling.
That smile had ruined him.
The moment he reached for the frame to straighten it — the overhead light flickered.
Once.
Twice.
Then steadied.
He stood still, frame in hand, staring at his own reflection in the glass.
But behind his reflection—
Another face.
Not her.
Not Panda.
Not anyone he recognized.
Just for a moment — pale, expressionless, standing in the hallway behind him.
Nanda whirled around.
Nothing.
Empty room. Silent. Still.
His breath caught in his throat. The photo frame slipped from his fingers and shattered on the floor.
From somewhere deep inside him, a tremor rose — not of fear, but of knowing.
This wasn’t just exhaustion.
Something was happening again.
Nanda stood still, the shards of the photo frame scattered at his feet.
But he wasn’t in his room anymore.
The walls had vanished.
He was standing in a narrow hallway — dimly lit, lined with peeling blue paint. The kind of building from his childhood. The concrete beneath his feet was cold. Damp. Familiar.
He turned, unsure how he got there.
The air smelled of rust and old ink.
Ahead, a door creaked open.
Light spilled from inside. Fluorescent. School-light.
His feet moved without his will.
Inside, he saw rows of wooden benches, empty. The old classroom. The one where he used to wait alone after school while his mother graded papers.
At the far end of the room, a little boy sat with his knees tucked to his chest.
Four years old. Tear-streaked cheeks. A water bottle hanging awkwardly around his neck.
It was him.
Young Nanda.
But the boy wasn’t crying.
He was staring.
At the corner of the room.
Where a tall, faceless man stood.
No features. Just an outline. Like someone had sketched him in charcoal and forgotten to give him eyes, a mouth, a soul.
Yet the boy didn’t scream. He just watched him.
“Who are you?” grown Nanda whispered.
The boy didn’t answer.
Neither did the figure.
Instead, the figure stepped forward. Slowly. No sound. No footsteps. Just… advancing.
The boy whimpered and shrank against the bench.
And Nanda remembered suddenly — this had happened.
Not exactly like this. But the feeling.
The overwhelming dread.
That something would hurt him, and no one would come.
Not his mother, too busy.
Not his father, never there.
Not even God.
He ran to the boy, trying to protect him — but the closer he got, the slower he moved. Like wading through wet cement.
“Don’t be afraid,” Nanda whispered. “I’m here now.”
But the boy just looked at him, eyes wide and deadpan, and said:
“You’re the one who left me here.”

        number:4,
        content: `The dream continues…
Nanda is already inside the corridor — metallic, humming, endless.
Cold fluorescent lights flicker above. The air is sterile, heavy with chemicals and something older… like decay buried under metal. Every door he passes is sealed, numbered in red:
B-03. B-04. B-05…
From somewhere behind one of them, a scream. High-pitched. Childlike.
Nanda’s breath catches. He turns toward the sound, but his feet don’t move. As if the floor itself has gripped him.
His hands trembled. He didn’t know why. He didn’t know this place. And yet… he did.
A group of men in white coats stood around a metal table. Wires dangled from the ceiling. Monitors beeped. One man stepped forward, adjusting the controls. Calm. Precise.
Nanda moved closer. Then — a voice from behind the nearest door:
“Why did you come here…?”
Muffled. Familiar.
“Nanda… you shouldn’t have come. You made a mistake.”
He steps back, heart racing. The voice wasn’t threatening. It was warning.
And just as he turns to run—
A sharp stab to the neck.
Cold rushes through his veins.
He gasps, grabbing at the syringe lodged in his skin. His vision swirls. Knees buckle. He collapses to the ground.
Footsteps approach.
A figure crouches beside him.
The face under the surgical mask came into view.
Panda.
Expression unreadable. Calm. Almost… detached.
“You were never supposed to see this,” he says softly.
The walls dissolve into darkness.
Nanda jolted awake.
Sweat soaked his collar. The room was still. The frame — still broken. One shard had slid under the desk.
Had it moved on its own?
He sat up. The clock read 3:17 AM.
Somewhere beyond the window, the city slept.
But Nanda couldn’t.
 Because something in that dream felt too specific.
 Too detailed.
 Too real.
And the worst part?
He couldn’t tell if he was remembering something…
…or being warned. 
He looked around, breath catching.
Then he saw it: a brown parcel just outside his door, and taped to the top — a note.
“Breakfast. Don’t overthink. Just rest today. —Panda”
He stared at it, the ink blurring slightly through the moisture in his eyes.
Rest today.
 But how could he?
The dream still pulsed beneath his skin. It wasn’t like the others — this one had weight. Detail. That child. The hallway. Panda’s voice. The needle.
He held the parcel in his hands but didn’t open it.
Because now… he wasn’t sure if it had really been a dream.
Nanda jolted upright, breath ragged.
 The room was silent, but his heartbeat wasn’t.
That voice from the dream echoed through the walls of his skull.
“Why did you come here, Nanda…?”
 “You made a mistake…”
 Then — the sting.
 The syringe.
 And Panda’s face, cold, unreadable.
He touched the side of his neck instinctively. Nothing there now. But the feeling — the violation, the betrayal — it stayed.
The glass frame lay where it had last fallen. Still broken. Still accusing.
He didn’t wait for the sun.
He threw on his joggers, laced up his shoes, and stepped into the pre-dawn dark.
The streets were still sleeping.
 Only the stray dogs acknowledged him. A few rickshaws passed. A milk van hissed through the fog. Nanda ran past them all, mechanical, as if movement could overwrite memory.
Panda’s voice still rang in his mind. Over and over.
“You made a mistake.”
At the gym, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Dumbbells clinked. Old Bollywood songs played faintly from a Bluetooth speaker near the front desk.
Heads turned as Nanda walked in.
“Ey bro,” someone called out. “Where were you, man? Everyone thought you—”
Nanda ignored it.
Someone else leaned in, trying to be friendly. “You good now? That video of you collapsing went around… kinda scary, bro.”
Nanda’s jaw clenched. He kept walking. Straight to the weights. Straight to routine.
 Bench press. Pull-downs. Deadlifts. As if nothing inside him had broken.
But the whispers didn’t stop.
“Dude, he’s acting like nothing happened.”
“I heard he was in the psych ward.”
“Didn’t he lose it after his girlfriend left?”
“He doesn’t talk to anyone now.”
Nanda gripped the barbell, palms sweating, shoulders trembling slightly from the previous set.
Just as he bent down to lift again, he heard it — a voice, sharp and mocking from across the gym.
“Look at him now… used to think he was the hero of the place.”
Laughter followed. Familiar.
Another added, just loud enough, “Guess karma’s got biceps too.”
Nanda froze.
He didn’t turn.
 Didn’t speak.
 Not yet.
His fingers stayed locked around the steel.
 His breath — steady, but heavy.
He knew those voices.
Two of them.
 Once loud, obnoxious, always circling the gym like they owned it.
 He remembered the day clearly — six months ago. The red hoodie girl, flinching as one of them tried to touch her arm, laughing it off like a joke.
Nanda had stopped mid-set that day. Walked straight over.
 And ripped into them.
Not with fists.
 With words sharp enough to echo.
The gym remembered that silence — the kind that follows truth.
They hadn’t spoken to him since.
But now, here they were. Barking again. Kicking a fallen man.
His eyes fluttered shut for a second.
 Everything inside him wanted to turn. To roar. To break their smirks with the same weight he carried in his chest.
But something held him back.
Not fear. Not defeat.
Just exhaustion.
 And a creeping doubt — was he even that man anymore?
He exhaled, and without turning, lifted the barbell.
 Muscles taut.
 Jaw clenched.
 Memories grinding like broken glass in his mind.
But the whispers kept coming.
“Dude’s mental now…”
“He just screams randomly… saw him do that last week too.”
Someone muttered something else — too soft to hear — but it was the last straw.
CLANG.
The barbell hit the rack, hard.
Nanda stood upright, chest heaving.
He turned around, eyes scanning the crowd.
“EEEYY!!! SSSHHHHHHH!!”
The gym froze.
No music now. No breath.
 Just silence thick enough to taste.
Nanda’s glare scanned them all. Not angry. Not wild.
 Just… tired.
Then, without another word, he turned back.
Picked up the weight again.
And went on lifting — like silence was just another rep.
Nanda racked the last set in silence, wiping his brow as if the moment hadn’t just cracked the air in the room. Most of the gym had quietly gone back to their routines — pretending they hadn’t heard. But their eyes still lingered.
The trainer approached, towel draped around his shoulder, gaze soft but hesitant.
“Nanda…”
He didn’t respond at first.
“Nanda, listen. It’s better if you… take rest for a while.”
That made Nanda pause. He turned, breathing steady now. “Rest?”
The trainer lowered his voice. “Those two — the ones you shut down last year — they’ve… changed a bit since. Helped the gym. Sponsored a lot of this new equipment. Renovation. Even the new AC.”
Nanda looked around slowly. Bright chrome. New punching bags. A fresh coat of paint on the back wall. Money talks.
The trainer sighed. “They’re not happy you’re back. I can’t afford drama, man. I’ve already got pressure.”
“You want me to disappear,” Nanda said plainly.
“No! No. I just—” The trainer faltered. “I just can’t go against them. Not now. I’m sorry.”
Nanda looked at him for a long second.
 Then, a faint smile tugged at the corner of his mouth — not bitter. Just… done.
He nodded once, slung his gym bag over his shoulder, and walked out.
The road home was longer than usual.
His feet wandered.
Unthinking — until they weren’t.
He found himself walking the same street he’d fallen on.
 Where it all began.
Where he collapsed into seizures.
He scanned the sidewalk.
That tree. That line of shops. That broken drain cover.
 Every detail exactly as it was.
But now, his eyes searched deeper.
Above the provision store — a CCTV camera.
 Rusty. But blinking red. Very much alive.
His heart stopped for a beat.
Then a memory surged:
“Police looked into it. Hit and run. No leads. No CCTV.”
 Panda’s words.
 The report.
 “No witnesses. No footage.”
Nanda’s stomach turned.
 His breath quickened.
He lied.
He gripped the railing beside him. A low hum echoed in his ears.
 His knees wobbled.
It was happening again.
The weight.
 The darkness.
A sudden honk. Screams.
“DO YOU WANNA GET HIT AGAIN?!”
“Man’s making it a habit now!”
“What is WRONG with this guy?!”
A small crowd had formed. Judging. Laughing. Dismissing.
Nanda didn’t argue.
He ran.
Fast. Desperate. Head pounding.
When he reached his apartment, chest still heaving, he nearly tripped over something on the doorstep.
A cloth bag.
Fruits. Vegetables.
And on top, a note. The same handwriting. Always the same voice:
“Man, again to the gym this early??
 Fine. Your manager wants you in the office.
 He called me.
—Panda”
Nanda stared at the bag.
No anger this time.
Just the hollow chill of someone realizing:
Is he doing all this because he is planning anything ? or is that how he always behaved…..
So, now he plans to go back to work………`,

        number:5,
        content:`The office building hadn’t changed. The same cracked tile near the elevator. The same overused coffee machine hissing steam in the hallway. But to Nanda, it all felt… staged. Like a set someone had reassembled just enough to fool him into thinking life was normal.
He walked past the reception. A few employees looked up — then immediately looked away. Except one.
 “Hey, look who’s back,” a guy from analytics muttered, nudging his colleague.
 Whispers trailed behind him like smoke.
 “Did you hear? They say he completely lost it.”
 “Wasn’t he found lying on the road or something?”
 “I heard he screamed in his sleep… in the hospital.”
 “Ever since that girl left—”
 “He’s gone bonkers.”
 A muffled laugh. A fake cough to cover it. Someone cleared their throat a little too loudly.
Nanda kept walking. Head straight. Eyes fixed ahead.
 The old him would’ve snapped — maybe hurled a chair, maybe worse. But today… rage didn’t find a way out.
 It just swirled inside him. Waiting.
 Because he was scared.
 Because what happened this morning at the gym — what he remembered — could happen again here.
 And if it did, it might not just end in whispers.
 It could end with him being fired.
So instead… He observed.
He sat at his desk. Stared blankly at the monitor.
 The dream played on loop.
 The corridor. The flickering light.
 The child sobbing.
 The voice: “You shouldn’t have come here.”
 And then — the cold jab of a syringe.
 Panda’s face.
 His skin crawled just thinking about it.
 Was it a buried memory?
 A hallucination?
 Or both?
Ping.
 A message blinked on his office chat:
 “Please report to Mr. Raghavan’s office.”
He stood up and headed toward the glass cabin.
“Come on in, Nanda,” Raghavan said without looking up. “How’s your health?”
 Before Nanda could answer —
 “Don’t bother. You’re upright, not drooling — good enough for me.”
 A hollow laugh. Solo.
Raghavan leaned back slightly, adjusting his collar.
 “Look — we’re not going to throw you back into the deep end right away. No pressure.”
 A pause. Calculated.
 “You’re being moved to a different team. Support role. Easier pace.”
Nanda frowned. “Different team?”
“Still the same project. Same compound. You’re just not leading anymore,” Raghavan said, glancing at his monitor. “Think of it as… collaborative redemption.”
 He smirked, then added,
 “You’ve always had a knack for sorting messes out, right?”
 A beat.
 A muffled laugh — like he found his own words funnier than they were.
 “Except, well… some messes.”
Nanda’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing.
Raghavan continued, almost too casually, “Anyway. The neuro-stabilizing drug work — you remember it, I hope?”
“I do,” Nanda said, voice low.
“Great. Then figure it out quickly from where you are. The client wants numbers, and we can’t afford delays.” He waved a hand dismissively.
 “You’re still in the building, Nanda. Just… not at the head of the table anymore.”
Dismissed.
 He walked back to his desk, unsettled.
 That phrase again: “Among other things.”
He opened the system, but now with new eyes.
 Folders marked “external testing.”
 Access denied.
 Why? He used to have access.
 What had they taken away?
Then the elevator dinged.
 And through the glass doors — Panda.
 Not inside. Just… standing near the canteen. Talking to someone.
 A stranger. Dull green jacket.
Nanda froze.
 That jacket.
 The same one that was draped over Raghavan’s chair this morning.
Animated talking. An envelope passed.
 And then — gone.
Something didn’t just feel wrong.
 It felt designed.
He opened the debug terminal — an old bypass tool he wrote himself.
 Accessed deeper logs.
Project: PND-A
 Supervisor: REDACTED
 Access Level: Internal Clinical Wing Only
PND-A.
 Panda.
 No coincidence. No chance.
 He stared, breath shallow.
 Was Panda running a project… named after himself?
 And was Nanda a part of it?
His thoughts spun.
 His pulse spiked.
And then — his phone rang.
 Unknown number.
He picked it up.
 “Hello, this is Inspector Vijay,” the voice said. “We met this morning?”
 “Yes,” Nanda said quickly.
 “You filed a report about the hit-and-run incident, correct? We pulled up CCTV logs from the mart nearby.”
 A pause.
 “But footage for that day is… missing.”
“What?” Nanda stood up, chair scraping behind him.
 “Footage from the entire week has been erased. It doesn’t look like a malfunction.”
Nanda’s stomach dropped.
 He already knew.
 Someone was covering tracks.
 “I want to meet you,” he said sharply. “Right now. Let’s go to that mart together.”
Outside the Mart
 Nanda and the inspector stood facing the store manager — a pale, sweaty man already halfway into denial.
 “I’m telling you — we don’t keep footage more than 24 hours,” the manager lied.
 “That’s not what your policy says,” Vijay replied coldly. “I’ve already spoken to your corporate.”
The man stammered.
 Nanda snapped.
 “WHO paid you to delete it?”
 His voice cracked. “WHO?”
 “Sir… please…”
 But Nanda was done being calm.
 He shoved a display stand over. Boxes fell like dominoes.
 The sound ricocheted through the aisles.
 Customers turned. Staff froze.
 Then — finally — the manager whispered:
 “Someone… a corporate guy. Suit. Offered a huge amount. He said he wanted specific days deleted. Had a pen drive and everything. I didn’t ask more.”
“You didn’t ask more?” Nanda shouted.
 But before he could say more — the inspector stepped between them.
 “We’ll recover the backups,” he said. “Don’t worry.”
INT. POLICE LAB – LATE EVENING
 The room was dim. A few low desk-lamps glowed over keyboards and hard drives. Fans whirred softly. A single ceiling tube flickered every few seconds, like it too was nervous.
The officer tapped a few keys.
 “Here,” he said. “This is from the backup we retrieved. Same street. Timestamp — 4:03 AM.”
 Nanda stepped closer to the screen, heart pulsing behind his eyes.
The footage began.
EXT. STREET CORNER – CCTV FOOTAGE – NIGHT MODE
 It was silent. Just the empty road, blurred under a faint drizzle.
 Nanda walked into the frame.
 Gym bag slung across his shoulder. White shoes. Earbuds in. Head low, face unreadable.
 The street slept. No traffic. No sound. Nothing moved — until something did.
A jeep roared in from the left side — not speeding, not honking, just emerging from the fog like something summoned.
 And then, in a blink — WHAM.
 A massive rod, iron-forged, whipped out from the side of the jeep — and slammed into Nanda’s ribs, like the vehicle itself had grown an arm.
Nanda’s body twisted mid-air, limbs flailing before collapsing violently to the ground.
 The jeep halted. Still. Quiet.
 The canvas flap at the back lifted.
 A man jumped down.
 Boots hit gravel. Heavy. Measured.
He remembers that sound — the steady rhythm, like a war drum in the rain.
 A black hoodie, soaked around the edges.
 The man stepped out — tall, broad-shouldered, built like concrete.
 Nanda’s breath caught. He is recalling the whole scenario…
The police operator leans in.
 “Who the hell is that guy…” the officer mutters.
 The man on screen — still hooded — stood beside the jeep, calm, unshaken.
 Nanda now is able to visualize totally what happened that day… He could hear the car tyre screeching.
A spark flickered.
 A cigarette lit.
 The flame flared to life.
 And that cigarette — the tip burned crimson, unnaturally bright, like a red sun breaking through storm clouds.
 Smoke curled upward, thick and white.
 Not just smoke — clouds. Morning mist.
He didn’t check the body.
 Didn’t rush.
 He just stood there, smoking, like someone examining himself from the outside.
Footsteps entered the frame.
 Two older men from the alley — a coat and a grocery bag between them — rushing toward the fallen figure.
 The hooded man turned slightly.
 And at that precise moment — a gentle breeze.
 The hood slipped off.
 Nanda’s pupils widened.
The smoke parted — both on the monitor and in his mind.
 The face came into view.
 The nose. The angular jaw. That faint scar just above the left eyebrow.
 His own face.
Captured on camera.
 And remembered from inside.
 Not similar.
 Not a lookalike.
 Him.
Standing.
 Alive.
 Looking at his own unconscious body.
How…?
The officer’s hand dropped from the mouse. He looked up slowly, voice barely above a whisper:
 “Sir… that’s… you?”
NANDA – STAGGERED
 His throat tightened. The edges of the world blurred — but not with fear. With recognition.
 Something inside him unlatched — like a vault cracking open.
His voice came out hoarse.
 “It’s not a glitch. I remember that smoke. The sound… The… heaviness.”
The man in the video threw his hoodie back on, turned sharply, and ran — leapt back into the jeep’s deck, pounding twice on the roof.
 The vehicle accelerated and vanished into the fog.
NANDA (softly)
 “That wasn’t just footage. That was real. How’s that even possible????”


The screen had flickered.
The footage had stopped.
But the silence that followed?
 It kept growing. Breathing. Watching.
A low hum in the lab. A sterile glow from the monitor. Vijay turned toward him, about to speak—
But Nanda’s phone buzzed.
Once.
 Then again.
 And again.
He didn’t reach for it. Not immediately.
His eyes were still locked on the screen — not because of what he saw, but what he felt.
 That face. That man in the frame.
 The same features. The same walk.
 Him.
 And yet—not him.
Another buzz. This time, a call.
Reluctantly, as if waking from some underwater dream, Nanda took the phone. His thumb hovered. He answered.
It was his mother.
Her voice was slow today. Soft. And heavy — like it had been walking for years and just sat down.
“I’m not able to run to school like before, Nanda… My knees ache. My arms too. Even standing for ten minutes feels like a punishment now…”
A honk exploded from the street outside — a bus tearing past the station.
 Her voice disappeared under it. As if the world itself didn’t care what a mother had to say.
When the sound faded, she was still speaking — but faint, like a dream dissolving mid-sentence.
He ended the call before she could say more.
 Because he already knew.
 And somehow, hearing more would only make it worse.
He looked down at the phone screen.
There, glowing among the app icons, was a message notification.
 From his father.
Nanda. I lost my job.
 The thunder came right on cue.
 A low, growling rumble that didn’t feel like weather, but judgment.
But I’ve already started looking again. Don’t worry. I have savings. I can manage for about a month.
 But after that… I’m not sure. I just thought I should tell you… so you don’t plan any expenses.
That last line blurred.
Because Nanda’s eyes had filled.
 Quietly. Instinctively.
 Tears gathering like clouds before anyone notices a storm.
And just then—his memory stung him.
That message from the morning.
“Reminder: EMI due. Your account balance is insufficient. Penalty charges will apply.”
The words had stung at dawn. Now, they tore deeper.
The money — the savings he’d once had — had flown out months ago.
 Piece by piece.
 Lab bills. Clinic visits. Medicine. Diagnostics.
 Each swipe of the card another handful of sand tossed into the wind.
It wasn’t just his father’s job slipping away.
 It was his past, his present, and even the fragile rope of future he’d been hanging onto — all fraying at once.
Outside, the storm rumbled again. But inside the police lab, it had already begun.
The windows trembled.
And from the officer’s desk, loose files lifted.
 Sheets fluttered into the air — reports, Xeroxed forms, fingerprints, statements — all twirling upward like a flock of startled birds.
Receipts. Documents. Names. Numbers.
 All dancing with the wind — the very image of Nanda’s scattered life.
Papers spun through the room like forgotten currency — weightless, meaningless.
Just like the money he no longer had.
His thumb hovered again — this time, to close the message. But before he could, another notification popped.
Instagram.
Tagged in a story.
He opened it, almost like reflex.
There she was.
Her.
Laughing in a party dress under string lights. A drink in hand. Surrounded by friends.
The text on the screen?
“Never seen anyone as immature and emotional as him. Honestly, what a fool 😂💀”
His name tagged — right there in front of everyone.
Another thunder cracked.
 This time, sharp.
 Like a whip tearing the sky in half.
A tear slid off his chin — landed on the phone screen.
The next story started auto-playing.
 Her birthday party. Smiling faces. Laughter frozen in time.
But he couldn’t see it clearly.
The screen was wet now.
 Smudged with rain. Or tears. Or both.
He tried wiping it.
 It slipped from his hand.
 Clattered on the floor.
He didn’t pick it up.
Because something had broken.
 Not just the screen. But something inside him. Something older.
The glass door to the lab began to pepper with raindrops.
 Soft at first. Then harder.
 Then furious.
He stood.
Didn’t speak.
Just walked — straight through the door, into the storm.
“Nanda! Wait!” Vijay called after him.
 But the wind swallowed the voice before it could reach Nanda’s ears.
Outside, the world had turned feral.
Dust swirled in frantic spirals, as if the earth itself was unraveling.
 A fine layer of sand stung Officer Vijay’s eyes, forcing him to squint, his vision blurred.
 He tried to follow Nanda’s silhouette — but the storm had already begun erasing it.
The drizzle had started too — not gentle, not forgiving — but sharp.
 Each drop hit like a tiny stone against the ground, the glass, the skin.
 Like pain had learned how to fall from the sky.
And Nanda… he kept walking.
Shoulders sunken. Head bowed.
 Tears leaking quietly from the corners of his eyes — and yet, the wind was so merciless, it flung them back across his own face.
 As if the sky didn’t want to waste a single tear — as if the world wanted him to taste his sorrow twice.
His body moved, but his mind wasn’t with him.
 His legs walked, but his soul… was somewhere else.
He wasn’t ignoring Vijay.
 He just couldn’t hear him anymore — not through the thunder in his chest and the storm in his head.
And so, Officer Vijay… gave up.
He lowered the hand he’d reached out.
 Blinking through the dust and sand. Watching Nanda disappear into the storm.
 Like a man stepping out of one reality — and into something far more unforgiving.
Thick sheets of rain lashed the street like punishment.
 Covers were torn from parked bikes. Papers danced like ghosts.
 Plastic bags flapped against signboards like they were begging to be let in.
 Car horns. Bike horns. Buses screeching.
Chaos. All of it.
 But Nanda — he walked like none of it mattered.
He wasn’t angry. He wasn’t thinking.
 He was just moving — like a puppet whose strings were pulled by memory.
Past the gutters overflowing with city sludge.
 Past the tea stalls trying to hold onto their tarps.
 Past the hunched silhouettes of people running for shelter, as if the rain was chasing them.
And then — the tracks.
Steel, slick with stormwater.
 A train was slowing down — its wheels grinding against the rails, screeching low like an animal in pain.
 The engine let out a honk. Long. Hollow. As if it were calling out to him. Like it somehow knew.
Wind tore across the platform and through the fencing, kicking up loose sheets and plastic wrappers that danced around Nanda’s legs.
 The debris whirled off the track, pulled by the wind that followed the train.
 It wasn’t just litter — it was memory in motion. Forgotten things returning.
Inside the train, through the open doors, a boy sat near the edge — tiny, brittle, crying into the hollow space of his hunger.
 Behind him, an old couple stared out a cracked window. Not at the boy. Not at Nanda.
 Just up. At the bruised sky.
 Their eyes weren’t desperate. Just… waiting. Like they were asking heaven for one last miracle.
But the train moved on.
 And so did Nanda.
The noise dulled now — like the storm around him had sunk beneath the louder storm inside.
His mother’s soft voice returned.
“I’m not able to run to school like before, Nanda… my knees are aching… I’m unable to stand for long…”
 That fading voice — lost beneath the horn of a passing bus — like even her pain didn’t get space in the world’s noise.
His father’s quiet shame echoed too.
“I lost my job… but I’ve started looking again… don’t plan any expenses for now…”
 And underneath those words — that same helplessness.
As Nanda veered left from the road, the lake revealed itself.
 The place that once felt like calm.
The place he’d laughed beside someone he once trusted with his whole, foolish heart.
The rain had softened the earth, but his knees hit hard as he fell.
 Right there — like gravity had given up pretending he could stand.
Memories hit like flickering film.
A smile.
 A laugh in sunlight.
 Her fingers brushing his.
 Moments by the lake. Shared secrets. Stolen silences.
Then the flicker — sharp.
Her Instagram story.
 Her voice tagged to a song he once shared with her.
 “Nanda is such an emotional idiot.”
 “Never met someone so immature in my life.”
He didn’t even swipe.
 His tear landed on the screen — the story moved on without him.
 A birthday party. Her smile. Surrounded by everyone.
 Everyone but him.
The betrayal etched into pixels.
Another flicker — his gym.
 The clink of weights.
 The cheers the day he won gold.
 The scent of iron and sweat and belief.
Then — his gym trainer’s voice: “You should probably stop coming, Nanda. It’s… uncomfortable for others to see you like this.”
Flicker.
The manager’s words.
 “You’re off the project. Take time off. Maybe rethink your direction.”
Flicker.
Panda.
 That one friend. That one lifeline.
 Laughter, drives, coffee on footpaths.
 Late-night confessions. Inside jokes. That look of trust.
And then —
 The man in the footage.
His own face — on someone else.
 His own voice — without his mouth moving.
 His own life — fractured, mirrored, mangled.
Everything played in loops inside him.
And then —
He screamed.
Not a word.
 Not a sentence.
 Not even a name.
Just pain — torn from the body like it had been hiding in his spine for years.
 Like it had finally clawed its way out.
And the sky screamed with him.
The loudest thunder yet — a guttural rip across the sky, like even the gods had lost control.
His fists pounded the earth.
 Stones tore into his palms, but he didn’t care.
 Blood trickled down — quickly swallowed by mud and rainwater, washed away before it could be remembered.
The drops were merciless now.
Big. Cruel.
 Not falling — attacking.
 As if the sky had shattered.
 As if grief had become weather.
The lake rippled, churning under the force.
 Each drop cutting the surface like needles.
 Piercing. Stinging.
Plastic bags skated across the water like lost currency.
 Scraps. Receipts.
 Useless things that once held value.
 Now? Just ghosts of a life that couldn’t hold together.
He collapsed.
 Face-first into the soil.
 Breath caught in his chest like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to stay.
Hands limp.
 Mouth open.
 Eyes wide — staring at nothing.
And still — the rain.
Still — the thunder.
Still — the world collapsing, without pause, without care.
And for the first time in what felt like a lifetime…
Nanda cried.
Not quietly.
 Not politely.
 But like a child who had held back too long.
 Aloud. Wild. With no shame. No shape.
With the kind of ache that only the sky could understand.`,

“One, two, sky so blue… Three, four…”
Her voice wavered between singing and speaking, like she wasn’t sure which one she was doing. Now and then, the dull clack of plastic toys echoed out, followed by the low creak of a cupboard door opening too far, then closing too hard.

Vijay heard it all.
Every sound, every word — clearly.
And yet he didn’t turn around.

He sat on the floor of the living room, leaning against a cushioned chair, arms resting around his knees. His eyes stayed fixed on Nandini — seated on the couch opposite him, one leg crossed over the other, her fingers moving across her phone with quiet ease. A small smile came and went on her face.

The television played without volume, its glow spilling dim patterns on the floor. Outside, the rain drew long, silent lines down the glass door — soft and steady, like the sky itself had nothing urgent to say.

He didn’t speak.
Didn’t ask who she was texting.
Just watched, with the kind of stillness that comes only when there’s nothing left to change.`,
